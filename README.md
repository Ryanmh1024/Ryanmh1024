# Ryan Healy

I'm a **Second Year** Data Science major in the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/degrees/bsds) at the University of Virginia. I plan to complete the Analytics concentration in the Data Science major, along with an Accounting Analytics concentration through the [McIntire School of Commerce](https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/) and an Educational Analytics concentration through the [School of Education and Human Development](https://education.virginia.edu/). I've built foundational Data Science skills through my work including Python, GitHub, Docker, SQL, data wrangling, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, Flourish, linear algebra, calculus, and collaboration with colleagues for Data Science projects.

My main field of interest is Data Analysis and Visualization, preferably in a Business or Education domain (although I am interested in the Sports domain as well).
- Relevant project with [Anachart](anachart.com) through the [SDS Micro-Internship program](https://datascience.virginia.edu/pages/stephenson-experiential-leadership-fund-self) during UVA's J-Term called Stock Price Target and Ratings Analysis and Insights where my team delved into the relationship between stock analyst price target aggressiveness and average days to reach price target among tech companies in the NASDAQ-100.
